In all MOM interactions that have a parameter of datatype\n               HLAinteractionCounts, if an HLAinteractionCount element of the HLAinteractionCounts array would have a\n               value (interaction class, 0), the HLAinteractionCount element shall not be present in the\n               HLAinteractionCounts array. In other words, only HLAinteractionCount elements that have positive counts\n               shall be present in an HLAinteractionCounts array. From this, it follows that if all interaction class\n               counts have a zero value, then the HLAinteractionCounts array shall not have any elements in it; it shall\n               be an empty HLAinteractionCounts array.\n            "},"HLAsynchPointList":{"_type":"arrayDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAsynchPointList","dataType":"HLAunicodeString","cardinality":"Dynamic","encoding":"HLAvariableArray","semantics":"List of names of synchronization points."},"HLAsynchPointFederateList":{"_type":"arrayDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAsynchPointFederateList","dataType":"HLAsynchPointFederate","cardinality":"Dynamic","encoding":"HLAvariableArray","semantics":"List of joined federates and the synchronization status of each."},"HLAmoduleDesignatorList":{"_type":"arrayDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAmoduleDesignatorList","dataType":"HLAunicodeString","cardinality":"Dynamic","encoding":"HLAvariableArray","semantics":"List of designators of FOM modules."},"HLAinteractionSubscription":{"_type":"fixedRecordDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAinteractionSubscription","encoding":"HLAfixedRecord","semantics":"Interaction subscription information","fields":[{"name":"HLAinteractionClass","note":[],"dataType":"HLAhandle","semantics":"Encoded interaction class handle"},{"name":"HLAactive","note":[],"dataType":"HLAboolean","semantics":"Whether subscription is active (HLAtrue=active)"}]},"HLAobjectClassBasedCount":{"_type":"fixedRecordDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAobjectClassBasedCount","encoding":"HLAfixedRecord","semantics":"Object class and count of associated items","fields":[{"name":"HLAobjectClass","note":[],"dataType":"HLAhandle","semantics":"Encoded object class handle"},{"name":"HLAcount","note":[],"dataType":"HLAcount","semantics":"Number of items"}]},"HLAinteractionCount":{"_type":"fixedRecordDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAinteractionCount","encoding":"HLAfixedRecord","semantics":"Count of interactions of a class","fields":[{"name":"HLAinteractionClass","note":[],"dataType":"HLAhandle","semantics":"Encoded interaction class handle"},{"name":"HLAinteractionCount","note":[],"dataType":"HLAcount","semantics":"Number of interactions"}]},"HLAsynchPointFederate":{"_type":"fixedRecordDataType","owningModule":0,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAsynchPointFederate","encoding":"HLAfixedRecord","semantics":"A particular joined federate and its synchronization point status","fields":[{"name":"HLAfederate","note":[],"dataType":"HLAhandle","semantics":"Encoded joined federate handle"},{"name":"HLAfederateSynchStatus","note":[],"dataType":"HLAsynchPointStatus","semantics":"Synchronization status of the particular joined federate"}]},"Position":{"_type":"fixedRecordDataType","owningModule":1,"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"Position","encoding":"HLAfixedRecord","semantics":"Position in cartesian coordinates.","fields":[{"name":"X","note":[],"dataType":"HLAfloat64BE","semantics":""},{"name":"Y","note":[],"dataType":"HLAfloat64BE","semantics":""},{"name":"Z","note":[],"dataType":"HLAfloat64BE","semantics":""}]}},"theSwitches":null,"theNotes":{"MOM1":{"semantics":"The value of the Dimension Upper Bound entry for the Federate dimension is RTI implementation\n            dependent.\n         ","owningModule":0,"label":"MOM1","note":[],"elementNotes":{}}},"theUpdateRates":{},"theSyncPoints":{},"theTransportTypes":{"HLAreliable":{"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"owningModule":0,"name":"HLAreliable","reliable":"Yes","semantics":"Provide reliable delivery of data in the sense that TCP/IP delivers its data reliably"},"HLAbestEffort":{"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"owningModule":0,"name":"HLAbestEffort","reliable":"No","semantics":"Make an effort to deliver data in the sense that UDP provides best-effort delivery"}},"theTags":{},"theDimensions":{"HLAfederate":{"note":["MOM1"],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAfederate","dataType":"HLAnormalizedFederateHandle","upperBound":"","normalization":"Normalize Federate Handle service","value":"Excluded","owningModule":0},"HLAserviceGroup":{"note":[],"elementNotes":{},"name":"HLAserviceGroup","dataType":"HLAnormalizedServiceGroup","upperBound":"7","normalization":"Normalize Service Group service","value":"Excluded","owningModule":0}},"theTimeStamp":null,"theLookahead":null}
